    <h1>About the Brains behind Brainiacs.in</h1>
    <section>
      Looks like you are curious to learn more about us, haha! You are an
      interesting human being OR maybe a cat creature or some fictional role
      that has been given by your friends. You are an interesting being after
      all.
      <br><br>
      Well well well, regardless, here is more about <em>brainiacs.in</em>:
      <br>
      <h2>Why does this exist?</h2>
      <section>
        You know what? That is a good question and the answer is really funny.
        It is because the ideator keeps loves to make new friends and he would
        ask them which anime/fictional character he resembles the most but
        doing this over and over again got repetitive and hard to recall whom
        gave you which role and such. You can imagine that. Sooo yeahhh!
        That was the main motivation behind this project. To centralize that
        lol.
      </section>
      <h2>Who exactly are the brains behind <em>brainiacs.in</em>?</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Ideator, Maintainer & Programmer: <em>LaV</em></h3>
        <section>
          He is the one who thought of all of this and such. He loves to code.
          Actually, problem-solving and creating fancy things in general. He
          might even be making something fancy right now or maybe participating
          in a hackathon or leading a team project right now; assuming he ain't
          stacking cards or meeting new people in some event :p
          <br>
          <em>
            &lpar;He loves to communicate with people like share ideas and
            stories and such.&rpar;
          </em>
          <br>
          If you want to hire him, or have your fancy ideas that you think he
          might be interesting in creating, then feel free to contact him!
          <br>
          <br>
          Unfortunately, he does not have any social media account :p
          <br>

          <h3>Overpowered Optimizer: <em>interrrp</em></h3>
          <section>
            The backend used to be somewhat slow and it needed to be optimized.
            And yes, you guessed it, int optimized the heck out of it! He is
            the guy you definitely need in your team. He essentially
            re-designed and re-wrote the backend (and all under 2 days!)
            <br>
            Definitely check him out and maybe add him to your team if your
            organization needs something optimized or re-designed. Bro's
            a genius.
